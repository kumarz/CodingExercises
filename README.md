# InterviewQuestions
This is a collection of programs that covers a wide variety of questions that are very much useful when it comes to an interview of a Software Development. I have shared my ideas if coding data structures, algorithms and some interesting problem solving as well. This project helps us to get over the concepts of the fundamentals of Computer Science, that really helps to crack the phone/online/in-person interviews in the top notch companies. I keep adding then as I learn day by day, since googling in multiple websites and going thro lots of pages to get warmed up for an interview is kinda painful. Instead I would like to have them all in one place. So please have a look at them and feel free to take advantage of them.
